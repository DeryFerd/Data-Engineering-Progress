# 🛠️ Data Engineering Project: ETL & Analysis Pipeline

This project demonstrates a simple data engineering pipeline that covers the full process of:

1. **Extracting** data from an external source  
2. **Storing** it in a NoSQL database (MongoDB)  
3. **Cleaning and preprocessing** the raw data  
4. **Analyzing** the data for insight extraction  
5. **Exporting** results into a structured format for further use  

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Python** – for scripting and data handling  
- **MongoDB** – for storing extracted data  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NLTK / TextBlob** – for basic preprocessing and sentiment analysis  
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – for basic data visualization (optional)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your environment variables (e.g., API keys) to ```.env``` file.
4. Run the pipeline in stages:
   ```
   python src/extract.py
   python src/load.py
   python src/preprocess.py
   python src/analyze.py
   ```
## 📌 Notes
Make sure MongoDB is running locally before executing ```load.py.```

```.env``` is excluded from version control for security reasons.

Data volume and external API rate limits may impact performance.
